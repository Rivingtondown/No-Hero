Time plays a large role in the world of \V[50]. Not only does the changing of 
time effect the lighting, various elements are tied to the passage of time. 

There are four primary time periods: morning, daytime, nighttime, and 
midnight. Each time period consists of six hours. Expand this entry to learn 
more about each period.

\C[3]Morning\C[0]: Between the hours of 6 and 12.
\C[3]Daytime\C[0]: Between the hours of 12 and 18.
\C[3]Nighttime\C[0]: Between the hours of 18 and 24.
\C[3]Midnight\C[0]: Between the hours of 24 and 6.

The world will react to the dawning of these various time periods. Not only 
will the lighting change but NPCs will go about their schedule, going inside 
or out; crops will grow; fauna, plants, and other resources for foraging will 
appear and disappear, and resources like well water may replenish. 

When midnight strikes darkness will consume \V[50]. Being outside in the wild 
at those midnight hours is exceedingly dangerous so take caution and watch 
the clock on your HUD.

<text>
Every citizens of \V[50] has a job whether it be as a lowly \V[15], a 
mischievous \V[16], or dashing \V[17]. All of your characters are assigned a 
profession that grants them skills and abilities that only they may execute. 
Professions are different from a character's class, which determine how they 
conduct themselves in combat. Professions mainly shine as you move about the 
world outside of combat.

There are five professions to master in the world of \V[50]. Expand this 
entry to learn about each profession's abilities. 

\C[3]\V[15]\C[0]: Farming, Cooking, and Animal Husbandry.
\C[3]\V[16]\C[0]: Sneaking, Stealing, and Quick Wits.
\C[3]\V[21]\C[0]: Taming Animals, Beast Tongue, and Nature Sense.
\C[3]\V[20]\C[0]: Masonry, Carpentry, and Blacksmithing.
\C[3]\V[17]\C[0]: Nobility, Golden Tongue, and Merchandiser.

As you obtain new party members you will gain access to these various 
professions and, in turn, their abilities. Using these abilities will grant 
you experience in that profession and eventual advancement in their 
respective guilds. 

Visiting these guilds and advancing through them will give you access to new 
quests, items, and even skills that may prove useful, even in combat.

\C[3]Farming\C[0]:
Farming is how you generate ingredients from the land. Farming may only be 
performed on designated farm plots usually located within your home area. 
Different crops are available to plant at each different farm location and 
each crop requires a different level in your \V[15] profession. 

Once a crop is planted it may only be plowed in the \C[5]Morning\C[0]. To plow 
a plot your character needs \i[217] gardening tools. After a crop is plowed it 
must be watered with a \i[241] watering can. Players can refill their watering 
can at a well, and repair thier tools at an anvil. 

Reference the "Crops" page in your Adventurer's Guide Book from your game menu 
to learn about the various crops and their respective levels, yields, and grow 
times. 

\C[3]Cooking\C[0]:
Cooking is how you turn your ingredients into something useful; whether it be 
a boon in combat or a friend's favorite meal. You need recipes to prepare 
meals though, so find them in \i[243] recipe books, obtain them through 
quests, or learn them through the \V[15] guild.

\C[3]Animal Husbandry\C[0]:

Over the course of your travels you will collect hundreds of items. Various 
ingredients for cooking and alchemy, keys, equipment, and tools like the 
\i[217] gardening tools and \i[241] watering can make up only a fraction of 
the items you will find. 

Items may contain various tags and details so read their descriptions. A 
large majority of items can be used in combat but some are only accessible 
when you're in a safe position.

You can outfit your characters in various pieces of equipment to aid them in 
battle. Equip your gear by going to the menu and opening the Equip screen. 

Armor is divided into four categories; light, heavy, magic, and general. Each 
class can wear different armor from these categories. Warriors, for example, 
can wear heavy armor while Rogues may only be able to equip light armor. 
General armor is equipable by any class. 

Similarly, each class can only equip a subset of weapons. Generally a Rouge 
will be the one to equip daggers and blackjacks while your Warrior will be 
wielding an axe or sword. Ranged weapons and staves can only be equipped by 
those with the proper ability. 

Equipment is often imbued with a suffix and a prefix. Learn more about the 
various possibilities by expanding this entry.

\C[8]Dangerous Locations:\C[0]
The world of \V[50] is made up of two types of locations, safe locations and 
dangerous locations. Dangerous locations are typically dungeons, caves, and 
other dark zones. These dangerous locations are covered in areas of darkness 
where random encounters can happen at any moment. Safe locations consist of 
every other map where random encounters are rare or more commonly 
non-existent. The game will prompt you when you are traversing between these 
two types of locations. 

\C[8]Darkness:\C[0]
When in a dangerous location any area of the map not lit up by a light source 
is considered to be in "darkness". Areas in darkness are primed to initiate 
random encounters on the unsuspecting characters. Areas considered to be lit 
are the spaces adjacent to or on top of a light source, most typically 
torches and braziers. These lit areas are safe from random encounters.

<title> Wandering Enemies
<text>
In addition to random encounters in the darkness there will also be more 
brazen enemies who wander dangerous locations in plain sight. These enemies 
are territorial in nature or on patrol, as they will chase and engage player 
characters they see who get too close. These enemies aren't afraid of the 
light and will engage the characters regardless of if they have their lantern 
on or are standing in a lit area. Being territorial, however, they usually 
won't give chase too far and can sometimes be outran or outmaneuvered.

<name> Your Lantern
<icon> 212
<title> The Lantern
<text>
When walking in darkness your HUD will display the words "Darkness", this 
means that a random encounter could happen at any moment. To avoid random 
encounters while traversing the darkness you have access to a
\i[212] lantern, which you can toggle with the L key. The lantern will need
\i[180] lantern fuel to work but that fuel will slowly drain with every single
step you take in the darkness, indicated by a gauge on your HUD. Walking within 
lit up areas will pause the consumption of fuel, while leaving a dangerous 
location will shut off your lantern entirely.
