There are four primary time periods: morning, daytime,
nighttime, and midnight. Fertile plots are typically only
available during the morning hours (7 - 11 AM).

Crops take time to grow, the abundance of plants and fauna
for foraging may change based on the time of day, and
resources like well water may only be drawn every other
day or two.

useful; whether it be a boon in combat or a friend's
favorite meal. You need recipes to prepare meals though, so

Over the course of your travels you will collect hundreds of
items. Various ingredients for cooking and alchemy, keys,
equipment, and tools like the \i[217] gardening tools and
\i[241] watering can make up only a fraction of the items
you will find.

Items may contain various tags and details so read their
descriptions. A large majority of items can be used in
combat but some are only accessible when you're in a safe
location.

Items, most often equipment, is often imbued with a suffix

You can outfit your characters in various pieces of
equipment to aid them in battle. Equip your gear by going to
the menu and opening the Equip screen.

Armor is divided into four categories; light, heavy, magic,
and general. Each class can wear different armor from these
categories. Warriors, for example, can wear heavy armor
while Rogues may only be able to equip light armor. General
armor is equipable by any class.

Similarly, each class can only equip a subset of weapons.
Generally a Rouge will be the one to equip daggers and
blackjacks while your Warrior will be wielding an axe or
sword. Ranged weapons and staves can only be equipped by
those with the proper ability.

Equipment is often imbued with a suffix and a prefix. Learn
more about the various possibilities by expanding this
entry.
